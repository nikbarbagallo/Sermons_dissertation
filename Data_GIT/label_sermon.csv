Neither will you find specific words forbidding suicide, infanticide (killing newborn children) or same-sex marriages. Yet, the Bible clearly teaches us that these things are wrong. A small, but noisy group of people (who are very active on the Internet) wish to have you believe that the Bible condones abortion. Although it doesn’t take a Biblical scholar to conclude that the Bible forbids abortion, it may help you to see the facts laid out. Simply put, the Bible forbids killing innocent persons. If an unborn child is a person, abortion is prohibited by the Bible.

cjl1fmn758ndw0777h4hf75is,"I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed that article on Gay Marriage. I appreciate your loving outlook on this matter. Don't ever give up on the gays. This July 20th, I will have been back to the Savior 1 year. I once live in this life with my partner for 8 years, she left and then I had an adulterous relationship with Cris for 1 year. Prior to all that, I lived a life of adulterous affairs from the time I was 15 years old. It was last year July 1st that my ex-husband was killed in a tragic truck accident. My first thought was, ""I'm free, I can get back to God because now I won't have to go back to the ex."" My twin prayed hard for me. She prayed that I would lose my desire for the relationships I was in and God heard her. When I went down to that funeral and saw all them Christian Nation Church people (my old crowd:0) there, my heart melted. Darrell, there was not ONE day that went by in the whole 10 plus years that I was backslid, that the Holy Spirit did not chase me down. The minute I got out of bed in the morning and even when I was asleep and He woke me up, HE WAS THERE! I had panic attacks ALL the time (I was afraid of death and hell) Darkness filled my soul and home. When we got home from that funeral, I told my girls, ""Im getting back to God, I miss him."" It was fear of hell and missing Him that got me. I would sit out on my porch in the middle of the night and cry to Him, ""Please help me get out of this mess."" I was so depressed everyday and everyday I feared death. I stayed drunk to drown out reality and God but He was there:0) He NEVER left me alone! Never give up on them. Yes, they are mean and their thoughts are way off but they are depressed, unhappy, lonely and all that! I have two brothers that are homos too and they are the most miserable boys ever! I had to stand in between one that was gay and one that was straight last week because they were fighting and my heart was so broken for Gene (the gay one) The anger in his eyes was scary but my concern was more for him because I did not want to see him get hit. I love him even though I think he hates Pen and I at times because we are Christians now. God loves us and He wants everyone just to love Him back. He loved me even though I ran from him and spit in His face and said terrible things to Him. His mercy is so amazing to me! Becky (my ex)came to me once and told me she was scared of going to hell and that she was scared if the Lord came back. Now this girl has been gay since she was a little girl she says and she claimed that God is not going to punish her because of who she loves. She is a deep lesbian. I would show her what the Bible said about Homosexuality and she couldn't argue that (they all would laugh at me because I was a les and telling them what the Bible said) But for her to be afraid, I would have never thought that EVER in her. I know God turns them over and im not sure what all that means but I know ones that have been deep into it for years and they give a glimmer of hope in what they say from time to time. I came back. I saw Him with His arms open wide and I came running! Gene called mom crying last week because of what happened and he was saying God's name. He claims to be atheist. There is hope for them, don't give up on them! I thank God over and over that He literally chased me down, day after day after day! Regina and Sheryll Lynn would come to see me and they were so nice. They prayed for me and they were my friend no matter how I was living. Even now, sometimes I think women don't want to be around me because of my past but your mom and sister are constantly hugging me and they don't care or think im dirty. The minute I gave my heart to Jesus July 20th 1014 at that alter at your dad's church, I meant business with God. Cris had to move out of my home (we were not married), I had a wonderful bon fire in 90 degree weather to rid my home of Halloween, witch, magic junk! The wardrobe changed, the cigarettes went in the trash before I even left the house to go to church. The drinking stopped, drugs stopped, cussing stopped and now I am getting ready to cry. I get blessed when I think about what He has done for me!!! I never want to forget what he brought me from! I could be dead and in hell were it not for His mercy!!! I became a new creation because I obeyed and I meant and still mean business! He loved you and me and I just want more than anything to love Him intimately and to love what He loves and that is humans. He created us for his pleasure and that is so beautiful! If they will just get a TASTE of Him, oh boy they would NEVER go back! Get old fashioned holiness. Let Him live in you and walk with Him everyday. WOW, to have that is beyond my thinking. For Him to live inside of me HA!!! Hallelujah! He is so good! Pray for my ex, Becky, my brothers Gene and Tim and there are others that are gay that I know. On my street alone there are 6 and I hear more but not for sure. They are not out with it I suppose. My oldest daughter April is in a homosexual relationship and she knows the holiness way. She is a backslider so pray for her. Her daughter had leukemia and her dad died in that wreck so I don't know what it will take to wake her up but I am praying whatever it takes! Kevin's death is what woke me up and brought me back. I am seeking a great awakening for my America! God bless you and your ministry. You and Liz are so precious to me! Thank you for loving people like me (well the old me:0)",negative,nikbarbagallo@me.com,Sermons_labelling,1534718264000,210.272,http://www.sermoncentral.com/sermons/1-a-call-to-the-church-darrell-stetler-ii-sermon-on-homosexuality-195786.asp,,gay_para_1000_NOSODOM.csv,[]

I remember my uncle telling me when I was a teenager, ""Jenny, if you don't serve God at a young age, you will never know how far sin will take you."" Of course I knew it all and am like, ""Whatever, I will never do a lot of sin!"" Well look where it took me. Children out of wedlock by two different men, one verbally abused and the other physically abused, affairs that I cannot even count, alcoholism, drug addiction, homosexuality, abortion, lying, cheating, stealing and some sins only God knows about. When you choose not to serve Him the life that you reap BUT he forgave and now I get to live with Him forever and so can they if they will just get to know Him. He is so loving and kind and beautiful. I cant even think of an earthly word that is beautiful enough to describe Him! I hurt Him and he still loved me.

And as I watched the film and meditated on those lyrics, I had to surrender the “conservative holy-roller” within me to the compassionate Jesus-follower within. Why? Because that’s what Jesus would do. He would not see these characters as they were merely displayed on screen. He would see their hearts. Jesus would see the truth that lies beneath their identity crises, the cross-dressing Angel, the same-sex relationships, the heroin use of Mimi, and their bohemian life-style.

cjl16z5g87ngv0777j2augq24,"Twenty years after King James I of England received the first Bibles he commissioned to be translated into English, his successor Charles I commissioned 1000 more copies to be printed. Needless to say, he was not pleased with the result. As a matter of fact, he was so displeased that he fined the publisher a year’s wages and took away his printing license. What in the world had the publisher done to deserve all that? He left out one small three-letter word. In our Bibles, Exodus 20:14 14 “You shall not commit adultery. read more » . is only 5 words long. It says, “Thou shalt not commit adultery.” The word that King Charles’ publisher left out was “not”. So in that 1631 edition of the King James Bible, the seventh commandment commanded its readers that, “Thou shalt commit adultery.” I’m sure if a printer made that error today, the reaction would be different. Instead of the publisher being forced out of business, I’m sure that their sales would be off the charts. Of course, people have not needed a Bible misprint that commanded adultery to allow them to engage in immoral behavior, have they? The fact is that we live in one of the most sexually supercharged times in history. It doesn’t take any more than a quick flip through the TV Guide channel to see that. It is nearly impossible to avoid sexually charged images in our world today. From TV to billboards to magazine covers in the grocery store to storefront displays. Sexually charged images are feeding our sexually charged culture everywhere you turn. Who knows whether those images are the cause or the result of the immorality that abounds in our culture today. Activity that was hidden away in the back seat a generation ago is socially acceptable and even encouraged today. The statistics tell a sad tale. According to the Christian pollster George Barna, in 2003, 6 out of 10 Americans believed that it was morally acceptable to live together instead of getting married. The same number of people agree with actively engaging in sexual fantasies. Nearly half of Americans believe it’s OK to have sex with someone you’re not married to. Around 4 out of every ten Americans see nothing wrong with viewing pornography. And nearly a third see nothing wrong with homosexual sex. It’s no wonder that our society is in the condition it’s in. It’s no wonder our families are so messed up. But, in a way, even though it’s heartbreaking and disturbing, it’s easy to understand. It’s easy to understand, because the world is full of lost people. And lost people are going to act like lost people. People who are lost have no choice but to live in bondage to sin. Sometimes they are capable of reform, but apart from the cleansing blood of Christ and the power of His imputed righteousness, there is no victory over sin. We can expect nothing else from lost people. But here’s what’s really disturbing. Barna’s statistics show very little difference between people who call themselves Christians and those who don’t. In other words, these same sexual sins are nearly as much in the church as they are in the world. Statistically, among people who identify themselves as born-again Christians, nearly 4 out of 10 think it’s OK to live together without the benefit of marriage. The same 40% think actively engaging in sexual fantasies is morally acceptable behavior. Just as many or more people in the church are viewing pornography as those outside the church. According to his research, Barna indicated that more people in our churches today think it’s a sin to break the speed limit than people think it’s a sin to break the 7th commandment. That’s in our churches folks. No wonder they call us hypocrites. No wonder we can’t reach the world for Christ. We can’t reach the world for Christ because they see no difference in us. And they see no difference in us because there is no difference in the way we live. And there’s no difference in the way we live, because many times there’s no difference in us.

In other words, illicit sex with someone not your spouse, which could refer to both heterosexual and homosexual activity. Now, the word ""unfaithful"" here is taken from the Greek word, ""porneia,"" which is where we get the word pornography.

The idea here, is an immoral lifestyle on the part of your mate, i.e., a refusal to repent.

The entertainment industry is a multi-billion dollar industry annually. I saddens me that many in the church seek to find their entertainment from Egypt or the world. Every now and then I will hear people who have been around for awhile talking about the changes they have seen in society over their lifetime. One of the changes that always is talked about is the changes in the entertainment industry and the morality that is displayed on television and movies. Hollywood is busy seeking to portray to our society images that are contrary to God. If you watch television and even commercials you will see that there is an agenda there that they are trying to promote. You will see tolerance taught, you will see fornication condoned and modeled, you will see homosexuality glamorized, suicide mocked and a joke, you will see things like witchcraft and the occult glorified and even portrayed on children’s shows, you will see drinking and drug use presented as the norm, you will see a message telling people that if they would just have more things then their lives would be better off. I am telling you that these are the things that our world go to for entertainment and even people within the church are watching. One of the most popular shows on television is a show called “Desperate Housewives” which just from watching the commercials I feel dirty, violated, embarrassed, and my intelligence insulted. The sad thing is that Christians are watching those things without ever the conscience being bothered and even parents are allowing their children to find their entertainment from shows which degrade what we hold dear and then they wonder why in their teenage years and adult years they go astray. The reason is because they are receiving a mixed message. They are watching TV and movies that tell them that everything is okay and glamorous and then they go to church and they hear something different and see something even different from that portrayer from their parents.",negative,nikbarbagallo@me.com,Sermons_labelling,1534666379000,10.412,http://www.sermoncentral.com/sermons/dont-run-to-egypt-jason-cole-sermon-on-call-of-the-disciples-103633.asp,,gay_para_1000_NOSODOM.csv,[]

cjkzshuf63t2n0777w2q5zdn0,"Well, the first thing he says is that ""fornication and impurity of any kind, or greed, must not even be mentioned among you, as is proper among saints."" These sorts of behaviour are to be totally banished from our life together. The NIV puts it, ""There’s to be not even a hint of them"". We’re not only to avoid indulging in them, but also to avoid talking about them. Now let me suggest that one reason for that is that as soon as you start discussing these things they begin to take on a legitimacy. If they’re a legitimate subject for discussion then there might be some situations in which they’re OK. Can you see how this works, particularly in the modern context of relativism, where what I think is true for me but maybe not for you? This is the real power of the forces of liberalism today, both in the Church and in the wider society. If we can get euthanasia on the agenda, then eventually we’ll get to the point where we can agree on the situations in which it can be applied. (Just substitute whatever controversial subject you like: abortion, human cloning, homosexuality, casual sex, electronic implants, legalised polygamy, legalisation of drugs, etc.) But Paul says, sexual immorality and impurity mustn’t even be mentioned among you. If you know that something is contrary to God’s law don’t even put it on the agenda. If you must discuss it with those outside the church, as we will because we live in a multi-faith society, then be united as a church in your attitude towards it. Why? Because we’re the saints, that is, God’s holy people, and such things are improper for the people of God, end of discussion. We’ll look at a moment at how we’re to judge what’s right for us to do, but for now, take this as a good rule of thumb for working out these sorts of ethical issues: if you were standing before God as you made up your mind, what decision would you make?

cjkyi2tf10xhu0777dl89f5tf,"An interesting thing happened at the Lambeth Conference that’s just finished. When the issue of homosexuality arose, the lead in the debate was taken, not by the western bishops, but by those from the third world, particularly the African Bishops. It was quite a turn around. We’re so used to the western Churches being the leaders and third world churches following. But over this issue the opposite was true. The African bishops took the lead and the result was an affirmation of the place of Scripture in determining Christian behaviour, and in particular that the teaching of Scripture ""upholds faithfulness in marriage between a man and a woman in lifelong union, and that abstinence is right for those who are not called to marriage."" Now I don’t want to discuss that particular issue today, though I’m happy to later. I raise it because of the response that the motion aroused from its opponents. One of the most vocal opponents was Bishop Spong who described the Christianity of the Africans as ""superstitious and coming from animism."" In an article in the Church of England Newspaper he explained the Africans’ problem like this: ""They’re yet to face the intellectual revolution of Copernicus and Einstein that we’ve had to face in the developed world: That is just not on their radar screen."" What he seemed to be saying was that they’re still waiting for the enlightenment to catch up with them."" They need to learn some of the lessons that we in the western world have learnt over the past 100 years. Then they’ll see the light. Now apart from the patronising tone of that sort of comment, can you see the fallacy of his suggestion? It’s that scientific research, and sociological study, and discussion by ethicists and philosophers can change our understanding of what God thinks is right.

We have an Episcopalian priest in Seattle who claims to be a Christian Muslim. The internet is filled with child pornography. You can’t drive down the street without having to explain to your children or grandchildren what Southern Exposure is or what gambling is. This past weekend, Atlanta held one of the nation’s largest “Gay Pride” rallies with over 300,000 in attendance. I haven’t seen the news from this year’s event, but last year, the only people arrested were Christians. They were arrested because they “were not carrying a message that is congruent with Atlanta Pride.” Meanwhile, none of the topless lesbians were arrested for public indecency. This Thursday, the US Senate will be opened with a Hindu prayer for the first time in history. You cannot get away from the fact that evil is abounding in America today. Just like it was in Israel. Justice was twisted. Righteousness was forgotten about. The only ones who weren’t tolerated were those who spoke the truth. They had so much wealth, they built houses they didn’t even live in. They had so much extra produce, they just wasted it. They just let their extra grapes hang on the vine and rot. Meanwhile, they didn’t even consider the poor. Except to steal from them. Sound familiar? Our fast food places waste enough food to feed all of America’s hungry. That doesn’t even consider what we waste in our own homes. We might not do everything we can to feed the poor, but surely we don’t steal from them. Well we sure do exploit them. Look at the lottery. Who buys most of the lottery tickets? How many lottery tickets do you think Bill Gates buys? But every time I go in the gas station, I end up behind somebody who can’t afford to pay attention, buying a stack of tickets. If that isn’t exploitation of the poor, I don’t know what is. And what do the good people do? Just like the Israelites did in verse 13. They keep their mouth shut. They’re not bothering me, so I don’t bother them. As long as they leave me alone, I leave them alone. The prudent keep silent for it is an evil time.

When he appeared in human form, he humbled himself in obedience to God and died a criminal’s death on a cross.” He wasn’t forced to die he chose to die.

The church is going to be under attack. We have progressed farther down the timeline toward the end of the world, Judgment Day. Christianity today is still under attack. The teachings of God and his word are still under attack. We could think of a long list of those things that have been tossed out by our society as no longer sin or even offensive. Even those things that according to common sense don’t seem to be right have been cast aside. A few examples--we have big decisions and votes in state after state concerning accepting same-sex marriage. We have votes and big decisions in Supreme Courts concerning putting unborn children to death. Those seem to be easy common-sense decisions. But our society has twisted them around. God makes it clear, and people are not willing to believe in common sense concerning the natural order of things or life’s value. How much less is the world inclined to believe when God tells them what is right and wrong. God says sin is still sin. Therefore God has chosen you to be saved to show the glory of God. We show the glory of God when we stand firm in God’s teachings. We honor God by hearing his word, because faith comes by hearing. We honor God by believing God’s word and not what the world’s words.

cjkye1nm406r30726qshcpvxj,"To completely comprehend the nuances of this subject “the Conquest of Canaan”, we need to consider two aspects. Firstly, while on Joshua’s generation lay the daunting responsibility of annihilating the strong inhabitants of Canaan and seizing the Land flowing with milk and honey, which God had promised to their forefathers ( Genesis 12:6-7 6 Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land. 7 The Lord appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built an altar there to the Lord , who had appeared to him. read more » . ), the picture becomes complete and lucid only when we focus on the second aspect that is the terrible spiritual state of the Canaanites, at that point in history. The impending extermination, which loomed before the wicked Canaanites was actually a just punishment for their horrific sins (ripe for punishment now- Genesis 15:16 16 In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.” read more » . ) which amongst others included sacrificing of the innocent babies to loathsome idols, homosexuality, having sexual relationship with animals etc ( Leviticus 18:21-28 21 “‘Do not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Molek, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the Lord . 22 “‘Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable. 23 “‘Do not have sexual relations with an animal and defile yourself with it.

The latter observation (the imminent just punishment of the Canaanites) leads to a subject within a subject. Can God punish the heathen, who do not have His written law and as such may not be bound by it? The Bible answers this question with an emphatic YES, since “God’s laws are written within the hearts of everyone (Jew or gentile)”. Does not the inbuilt divine alarm piece within every human being (conscience) immediately start ringing, the moment anyone does anything wrong in violation of God’s moral code of conduct ( Romans 2:12-15 12 All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. 13 For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. 14 (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law. 15 They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.) read more » . )?",negative,nikbarbagallo@me.com,Sermons_labelling,1534534207000,7.763,http://www.sermoncentral.com/sermons/hail-omnipyschologist-suresh-manoharan-sermon-on-comfort-163930.asp,,gay_para_1000_NOSODOM.csv,[]

Jesus even raises the issue of our lusts and inward coveting as equally reflecting our adulterous hearts. Homosexuality is simply one of many violations of the sanctity of our sexuality. The moral question regarding homosexuality hasn’t arisen because God’s heart isn’t clear, but rather because our hearts have become misguided in terms of living in this light.

cjky3w46r8s4k0704y2kmf7ry,"Amy Tracy was raised in a dysfunctional home that focused on performance (Christian Reader July/August 2000). Amy bloomed in high school as a cross country runner, and her dad was a typical sports obsessed father, who constantly prodded her to perform. When she stopped winning races, her family grew disappointed with her, and she began to grow depressed. In college Amy got into drugs and alcohol, and her junior year she developed a kinship with several professors who she knew were gay. She was drawn to their sense of community, and ultimately Amy concluded that she was gay. Soon afterward, Amy committed her life to women’s rights, and she became actively involved in the pro-abortion movement. Yet there were times Amy was filled with a profound sense of emptiness and sadness, a longing for peace and joy that she didn’t find in the way she was living her lives. As she looked at the Christians who marched against her in abortion demonstrations, all she saw was anger and hatred. In Amy’s words, ""Christians lived down to my low expectations."" Yet Amy started feeling like she was falling apart, and she concluded that her emptiness was a hunger for God himself. By now Amy had become the press secretary for the National Organization for Women. One night in Washington, D.C. Amy ran into a pro-life activist she had seen at several abortion demonstrations. She made a sarcastic remark, expecting him to respond the same way. But instead, he said, ""Amy, all I pray for is the chance to see you standing in church, praising and loving Jesus. Forget the abortion debate. That’s all I really want."" Her hunger for God grew desperate, and finally she looked in the yellow pages for a Christian church. One Sunday she showed up, her pick up truck covered with rainbow flags and pro-abortion stickers. Amy wondered if she’d be thrown out, yet as the pastor spoke and the church worshiped, she sensed God calling to her. It took a while, but eventually Amy committed her life to Jesus Christ.

Christians there are greatly concerned because in the last two weeks, a Canadian court has essentially declared legalized gay marriage. Apparently millions of Canadians either don’t care or think this is a good idea. Let me add my two cents to the discussion: If we think this is just a Canadian problem, we are sadly mistaken. Gay marriage will soon “come south” to the United States. It’s not that far away—a matter of a few years, maybe sooner than that.

He used a real life example of a bridge being out, and how a man shot flares just over the top of cars to get them to stop and not drive over the bridge to their death. He again quoted Scripture that talked about the wages of sin being death, and how we were to avoid spiritual death at any cost. He talked about the beauty of morality, and told the story of a man who avoided being unfaithful to his wife when faced with the opportunity, and how his marriage blossomed after that and became better than ever. He talked about heaven and how wonderful it would be — streets of gold and gates of pearl with a beautiful river running through it.

Those with hearts of unbelief will never see the glories of heaven, nor the mighty hand of God in their lives here. 2) Our society is all about throwing off the God-given roles in creation. Feminist movement, homosexual movement, environmentalist movement, evolutionist movement. You will meet a fiery end if you participate in these things. We cannot discount the teaching of the bible regarding these things because it is not culturally relevant and politically correct. 3) You don’t have to be told that we live in a culture that it not in line with biblical sexual morals. But you should be warned that it can get you. Porn, adultery, fornication (any sexual contact outside of marriage), homosexuality, will destroy your life, your marriage, and your soul. It is surprisingly common in the church of Jesus Christ. It is a good indicator of these false teachers. Sexual sin is more destructive than other moral failures. It scars your soul permanently.

It is clear that it should be taken as an ethical matter. 19:19 clearly covers a ceremonial issue that illustrates the principle of keeping oneself pure. There is clearly no ethical issue involved.

cjky2gkq840t40784hxpy7dt6,"As we have seen in previous weeks, Paul admonished the Thessalonians, “Let us not sleep as others do, but let us be alert and sober. For those who sleep do their sleeping at night, and those who get drunk at night. But since we are of the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation” (1 Thess. 5:6–8; cf Rom. 13:13). He warned the Corinthian believers that they were not even “to associate with any so–called brother if he should be an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler—not even to eat with such a one” (1 Cor. 5:11). In the next chapter he went on to say, “Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God” (1 Cor. 6:9–10). The perplexity of some commentators regarding the occurrence of an admonition against drunkenness in the middle of this paragraph can thus easily be cleared up. The intoxication of drink is not introduced as a mere foil to spiritual exhilaration. It is a concrete example of worldly folly in wicked days and a sample of how fools make themselves utterly incapable of wisdom, sound judgment, and real understanding.

Most of us do not relate to this in our day and age, but there are ways we have tried to project human attributes and characteristics that we are fond of onto God. In essence we may have tried to recreate God in our own image the way we would like Him to be. So we have to ask the question, “Have we manufactured a tailor-made God who places a higher value on what political party a person may be a part of, or whether or not a person uses alcohol or tobacco or drugs, or what religious creed we subscribe to than on where a person’s heart is and how much of God’s love is flowing through it?” Have we remade Jesus to be a white middle class republican who faithfully attends church at least 3 times a week? That is not a bad image but God is so much bigger than our idea or representation of Him! He is big enough to love every sinner on this planet! He is big enough to reach out to the outcasts whose lives may be in bondage to addictions, to people who struggle with sexual sins, to those who embrace a different political ideology than you do.

Our earliest settlers left Europe to be free from the state church and for the right to worship as they chose. Our rights are something that we Americans hold dear. Do you know the reason our Constitution wasn’t immediately ratified by all 13 colonies? It was over the idea of the Bill of Rights. Some colonies wouldn’t ratify the Constitution until they were included. So did that mean that the other colonies didn’t think the rights laid out in those 10 Amendments were important? No, they thought the Bill of Rights could be seen as limiting our rights to only those 10. They didn’t want our rights to be seen as limited by government in any way other than those spelled out in the Constitution. Our fundamental rights have always been important to us. So much so, that in many ways, we have taken it to the extreme. Our culture has now become obsessed with our rights. If the law says that a woman can’t kill her unborn baby, she says her rights are being violated. If a public place won’t allow public, graphic displays of homosexual behavior, they say their rights are being violated. If a child is told to turn his profanity-laced T-shirt inside out at school, his parents say his rights are being violated. When a school teacher sees ultra-violent tendencies in the writings of a student, it would violate their rights to suspend them. If an airport screener singles out a person dressed in Muslim attire to search, that’s racial profiling and violates their rights. We are obsessed with our rights. We demand our rights in every aspect of our lives. We demand our political rights. We demand our economic rights. We demand our medical rights. We demand our rights at school. We demand our rights at home. We demand our rights at church. But one of the biggest places we demand our rights is at work. As Christians we have certain rights in the workplace. And we have every right to demand those rights. As a matter of fact, we need to be obsessed about those rights. As obsessed as our culture seems to be with all its rights. In the passage we’re looking at this morning, Paul continues on the topic of submission that he introduced in 5:21. He does so by looking at the master/slave relationship. Of course we don’t have many masters and slaves in America today. At least we don’t call them that anymore. But the same exact principles apply to the boss/worker relationship in our jobs. Whatever our workplace is, we all have a boss/worker or as this passage puts it, a master/slave relationship. Whether you are a boss or a worker, a student or a teacher, a homemaker, self-employed or retired—whatever your station in life, you are either a boss or a worker. And as a Christian boss or worker, you have rights. This morning, I want each of us to leave this place ready to insist on our rights in the workplace. In order to do that, we’re going to look at four rights every Christian should have in the workplace. The first right is the right heart.

And through craftiness and cunning, they would tempt humanity causing her to doubt her lover’s intentions and motives. God’s creation would disobey him. His heavenly divine court forces him to cast humanity out of the garden and into a world of condemnation and bondage. A death sentenced is passed. Humanity is condemned to die. Her intimate relationship with God seems to have ended. She is forced to communicate with her lover from distance separated by a gap of sin and death. Their conversation is now done through slaughtered lambs and bulls. Judges, prophets, and priests are enlisted to carry messages from the throne room of God to the ears of his creation. However, humanity refuses to hear. Her transgression and exile transfigure her once beautiful image to one of disdain and repulsiveness. She is now shaped in iniquity and conceived in sin. She would break every agreement and covenant of her Lord. She would kill his messengers, and conspire with his enemies. And yet, through it all her lover, her creator God still loves her. Ahhh..His spirit still sings to her. Solomon captured excerpts of his love song to his people saying, “you have ravished my heart with one glance of your eyes. How sweet is your love, my sister, and my bride, how much better is your love than wine.” Ahhh..Our God still loves us. And that’s the message for someone here today. In spite of our sins, our God adores and treasures each and every one of his creations.

He wants to share the truth with the liar. He wants to give comfort to those who mourn. He wants to grant peace to those whose world is falling apart around them. He wants to declare liberty for all those who are oppressed. God still wants to give us the best His universe has to offer. He wants knows us intimately.

I will also give him a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to him who receives it. Did you ever wish that you could just go back and start all over again? This past Tuesday evening, I caught part of a movie called “Groundhog Day.” It’s about a man who wakes up every day at 6:00 to find that he is living the same day, Groundhog Day, over and over again. It’s like he’s given thousands of chances to live the day over until he finally gets it right. One of my favorite shows of the past was Quantum Leap about a man who went to different times in the past to set right what once went wrong. At the end of the day, when you lie down on your bed, did you ever wish you could do it all over again? When you’re sitting there in divorce court, did you wish that you could go back and not say those words you said or not do that thing you did? When you here the sound of the cell door close, do you wish that you had never bought that gun? The world doesn’t give you a chance to start over, but Jesus does. He says that he will give you a white stone – a clean slate –, and a new name so that no one who knew the former you will hold those actions of the past against you anymore. Your old name was “condemned by God”. Your new name, though known only to you and God, will carry this meaning: “a child of the King”. (1 Cor 6:9-11 NIV) Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. We all carried a name that separated us from God for now and for all eternity. We had the name “murderer” and “liar” and “adulterer” and “thief” tatooed across our forehead. But Jesus, by His blood, washed the stain away and has given us new start, a new name and a new destiny.

Still, all funny stuff aside- now we are not just advocating marriage between same sex partners, it is going on right now! Its reality, its not funny, it is happening, and its wrong. Its wrong because God said its wrong. Aside from God telling us that same-sex partners is an abomination, God tells us from the very beginning in Genesis 2:24 24 That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh. read more » . Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall CLEAVE unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. This is the way God designed and built man and woman- to be together, to express sexual intimacy, to work together and build a life together. That is interesting because when God made Adam and Eve, they did not have a father and a mother the way we have a father and a mother. They weren’t brought into the world that way, but this is the way God designed every human being after them to be. They were not born with certain inclinations for the same gender. Jesus alluded to the creative design of His Father when He said in Matthew 19 Divorce 1 When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan. 2 Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. 3 Some Pharisees came to him to test him.

Well, the very essence of our biological nature says that its wrong. By the simple way that God, in nature made us shows us that a man and a woman belong together. A man and a man and a woman and a woman were not built to express the kind of intimacy that a man and a woman can provide. Paul says this in Romans 1:20 20 For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse. read more » .

The worldviews that have the biggest impact on Christianity nowadays are actually tolerantism and inclusivism. The secular world teaches us it is politically incorrect to be intolerant and exclusive. No one likes anyone who is intolerant or exclusive. As a result of the conforming to this world, we begin to see more churches baptizing gay couples. We see pastors shying away from Jesus’ name if they think the name can be a stumbling block for someone to come to faith. Don’t get me wrong. I absolutely agree that we should try our best to reach out to the unchurched people. I would even welcome the unchurched people to be observers in the body of Christ. However, we need to be very careful in letting people know the cost to follow Christ. Christ never compromised or sugar coated the gospel message.

Second, the final verb, šākab, “to lie,” is often used to denote sexual relations. (Except for Gen 30:15–16 and 2 Sam 11:11, the relations are always illicit (incest, homosexuality, bestiality, rape, seduction): Gen 19:32–33; Lev 20:11–13, 18, 20; Deut 22:25; 27:20–23; 35:22) Third, the noun between these verbs, margĕlôt, derives from regel, “foot,” the dual and plural of which may be used euphemistically for the genitalia (Exod 4:25; Judg 3:24; 1 Sam 24:3 [4]; Isa 7:20 (all male); Deut 28:57; Ezek 16:25 (both female).

Wearing the eyeglasses of feeling and sincerity, they contend that passages which condemn nonmarital and homosexual relations are really condemning unloving and hypocritical acts. Though they cannot find any scripture to condone these “extra relations,” they still appeal to passages about love and reinterpret them to apply to today’s “enlightened” understanding of human sexuality. And many Christians have bought into it. Listen to these figures taken from the Barna Research Group. Only 32% of Americans claiming to be born-again say they believe in moral absolutes.

cjkvca9qrp9w40704s3fdvfj1,"Why did Paul want that for the Philippians? So that you may be able to discern what is best. This isn’t easy - especially in today’s world. Back even in Paul’s day he said that unbelievers - invent ways of doing evil; . . . they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. . . . they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them. (Ro 1:30-32) The problem we are having more and more with society is that people are approving of the very things that God’s Word clearly says is evil - and this is happening even within the church. It amazes me how so many churches are now allowing homosexuality and condoning pre-marital sex and living together before marriage. In the name of “freedom” the Man Boy Love Association seems to be advocating sexual relationships between men and children. However, when we call such acts evil, we are the ones who are called unloving and intolerant, while those who practice them are promoted as the loving and tolerant ones. It’s getting to the point in our society where it’s HARDER to distinguish what is good and evil from the way people are living. That’s why it’s more pertinent than ever to KNOW our Lord - not only who He is, but also HOW He wants us to live. If people really knew their Bibles and their Lord, they would know these modern day evils are not permissable. The problem is that people don’t!

cjkvbm6s5ltee0784ppljpk1z,"Enter 1960 what we commonly refer to as the postmodern period and understand “we are not in Kansas anymore Toto.” In graduate school this Fall I was required to write a working definition of postmodernism. Here is what I wrote: Postmodernism- A name for the time period in which we currently live. A time when there is no meta-narrative, no absolute truth. It is a period in time where mutually exclusive ideas can exist contemporaneously and tolerance means that if someone rejects ones behavior they have rejected and judged the individual, it is a time of contradiction because there is not a universally accepted worldview and all worldviews are acceptable except the Christian worldview because it is not pluralistic. There is not a single BIG story that is true. Truth is based on the community’s experiences. Christians one way you are perceived in the world is as a community among many communities, who holds a view among many views, who have created a truth –notice not the truth-but a truth that is relative to you among many communities of relative truth. How many times in sharing your faith have you heard “well, I am glad you found religion it seems to be working for you.” It could have been new age pantheism or Mormonism even a homosexual relationship. But in the eyes of the postmodern thinker-he is happy that you seemed to have found a solution and fulfillment for life’s many challenges and questions in this pluralistic world of many choices that actually works for you. Mutually exclusive ideas can exist at the very same time in a person’s life. We live in a shopping mall of choice a smorgasbord of pick and choose. I remember hearing the story of a Christian boy who believed Jesus was Lord and Savior, but when he died he would like to come back as the family dog because of the good life the dog lived. He had mixed two mutually exclusive views into his life Christianity and reincarnation. Our teenagers are inundated with a plethora of ideas from which to pick and choose. They reject the idea that truth is absolute and the metanarratives as too oppressive. To the postmodern mind spirituality is important and the way to solve the world’s problems is through tolerance. Tolerance means if you reject how I live, if you reject my homosexual lifestyle you reject and judge me! A mature Christian would argue with that position and would say, “tolerance applies only to persons, but never to truth. Intolerance applies only to truth, but never to persons. Tolerance applies to the erring; intolerance to the error2. We separate behavior and sin from the individual, we hate what God hates and we love what God loves. God hates sinful behavior and so must we, but God loves the people who are made in His image and so must we. Therefore, if people matter to God, they must ultimately matter to us.

cjkvbjs6ylt1b0784eh9tj4qh,"But that’s not the type of tolerance I want to talk about this morning. This type of tolerance is tolerance of actions. To be more specific, I want to address tolerance of sin within the church. What is the problem with tolerating sin in our church? The first problem is that it compromises the integrity of the Word. See this Bible, this is God’s Word. “… it is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteous. . .” so that we, as God’s children, may be thoroughly prepared for every good work. We are on a journey in this life. And, as it says in the book of Psalms, this is a lamp to our feet and a light unto our path. As children of God and as a body of Christ, we should follow this lamp wherever it should lead us. As we follow this lamp we use this to draw the line in our lives. In our Christian life we take this Word and draw a line in the sand and we say this is where God’s Word is and this is where I am not going to cross. I set my life standard based on where this Word is established. But too many times, as Christians, we take small steps away from this standard. We reason within ourselves, saying, “That lie is just a small lie and I’m just doing so I wont hurt their feelings.” And then we step across that line. We reason in our minds, saying, “ I didn’t study very well for that exam. I usually do pretty well but I just didn’t have time study like I needed too. It won’t hurt if I cheat just a little.” And you take another step away from God’s Word. Then you say, “ I know God has established the marriage covenant to be holy to be pure, but I have just fallen out of love with my wife. And this other person provides for my needs so much better. God wouldn’t deny me my feelings, would He?” Then you take another step away from the Word of God. Then you say, “This group of people call themselves homosexuals and I can’t deny them their feelings. They’re born that way. They can’t help the way they feel.” Then you take one more step, away from God’s Word. And before you know it you are so far away from the original line of integrity that God’s Word has drawn that you can barely see it on the horizon of your life. I want to challenge you today to establish God’s Word as the authority in your life.

cjkvbje9rp4u50704xtabb06a,"As you reject sin someone may look at you and say, “You’re being intolerant; therefore, you teach hatred.” Intolerance of sin is not hatred. This type of intolerance is a great expression of love. When God’s Word draws the line to say homosexuality is wrong, that must be the line the believer holds to. Someone may say, “You are homophobic, these people were born that way. We have no right to judge.” I’m not homophobic. I am hamartiphobic. Now, I know I just made up that word but it illustrates exactly what I am saying. You Greek students may know that hamartia is the word for sin. I am afraid of what sin can do. I am afraid of what sin does in an individual’s life and in the life of the church body. Sin is like weeds in a garden. If they go unattended, they can overtake the entire garden and kill every plant within it. Sin has the same affect on our lives. If we leave it alone, it would go away. We must take aggressive measures to remove the sin in our lives so that we can be clean vessels, so that we can be used by God to accomplish His business. Not only do we continually run from sin in our lives, we are to also pursue the righteousness that God requires of us. John MacArthur once said this about the Christian life. “There is a sense in which, as long as we are in the body, we can never stop running. If we stop running from what is evil, it will catch us. If we stop pursuing what is righteous, it will elude us.” Such is the life of a child of God. You see, sin prohibits you from being the man or woman that God has designed you to be.

cjkva1ykoot4f0704afrnbwil,"To a fellow play-actor “playing house,” looks real. To an adult, “playing house” is mere veneer. The same is true with those who are blessed with the Spirit. His presence within us allows us to see through sham and pretense. We can see through a person who is only play-acting at life, trying to live life on his or her terms only, even though the person and others in the same situation cannot see past the externals of behavior. Indeed, two people can engage in the very same activity, but it means two very different things. For instance, externally two people can engage in the same sexual intercourse, but internally it can mean very different things to them. When a Christian sees through another person’s behavior, it is not to judge that person. No, like a good parent, the Christian must wait for an appropriate opportunity and plan a strategy for helping that person also see through themselves. For Christians there is no justification for looking down upon or having self-righteous disdain towards those less fortunate. After all, we have all come to our senses through grace, not effort. Effort follows grace and depends upon grace for the energy to do what we otherwise would not or could not do. We Christians have no basis or cause to boast except in the Lord, for if we do so, we have slid back into the conceit that we can do something worthwhile on our own power.

His thoughts shall become my thoughts. His will shall be my will. Everyday this old nature, this earthly vessel is becoming a new creation, the old is passing away and the new is becoming a reality. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not all that I should be but I am more than what I was. I have not yet apprehended all that it is to be Christ like; but I have a greater knowledge of his nature. I can discern right from wrong; divinity from devil ness; sanctity from the satanic. I have greater sense of who Christ is and what I am not. The more I follow Christ. The more I learn who God really is and what I’m really not. And that’s good news. It’s good for me to know his reality and my identity. Because I don’t know about you, but I live in a world where I am always misunderstood and mis-labeled. I live in a socio-political environment that has a tendency to stereotype me based on misperceptions. I am misunderstood. Because I’m black, I’m often labeled as lazy, angry, undereducated, and lower class. Because I am a male, I often misunderstood as an oversexed, arrogant, macho, chauvinistic pig. Because I am single, I often misread as a skirt chasing, womanizing bachelor or an impotent closeted homosexual. Because I am educated and somewhat corporately established, I am often mistaken as a bourgeoisie ‘wanna-be’ socialite.

That Kingdom has come to Earth, it is the Kingdom that was established through the love of a Father and the sacrifice of His Son. As we go out and follow the call to expand the kingdom, our message is to be the same.

All of these are the responsibility of the Christian to speak and stand against but they cannot overshadow the message that needs to proclaimed. “The Kingdom of Heaven is Near.” We need to be proclaiming the love and sacrifice of Christ above all else.

This morning I want to put the two thoughts together and say a few words on what I’m going to refer to as “The Miracle of Marriage” Is marriage a miracle? If you look at the statistics then you would have to say that it is. In the last few months I’ve had several opportunities to tell folks that Sis. Judy and I dated for 2 years in high school and have been married now for 42 more. You should see the looks and hear the language as people respond to this statement. You can tell that they admire us for the length of time we have been together, and at the same time they are amazed that we have stayed together this long, in part because what was common place two generations ago is very rare these days. Twenty years ago when you read a newspaper there were many 50th wedding anniversary announcements but today it is a rarity. My mother and father-in-law have been married 63 years and I can assure you that today this is almost unheard of. When you couple that with what is going on culturally with marriage, like the gay marriage issue and co-habitation then you can begin to appreciate the difficulty that folks have today getting married and staying married for a lifetime! In our lesson today we have the first recorded miracle that Jesus performed and interestingly enough it was at a wedding!

Man makes a decision and God steps back and allows man to fulfill it to its fullest extent while understanding that there will be a day of reckoning.

But on one issue, they found agreement. It is time for both sides to turn down the rhetoric. Both sides need to stop portraying the other as the incarnation of evil. There are Christians who think Jerry Falwell has sold out on this issue and has become soft on homosexuality, but I don't think so.

cjkv74hp7o96j07043mbd3yz5,"Intro: Much of the focus in church today is on prophecy, in particular, where we are in the prophetic timetable. Much of the attention is centered on the events and trouble in the Middle East. People today are very interested in what the Old Testament prophets like Daniel, Jeremiah, Joel, Isaiah, and others have to say on the subjects such as the Great Tribulation, the rapture, and the millennial reign. Entire Old Testament books are being scrutinized for information regarding the prophetic timetable. Many look at Jesus’ words in His Mt. Olivet discourse regarding wars and rumors of wars, nation rising against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, famines, pestilences, and earthquakes. Certainly this is a passage that is very important to studying prophecy. Obviously the wars and rumors of wars is a very important statement in our study of prophecy. Everywhere we look we see nation rising against nation ands kingdom against kingdom. Worldwide in 1990 there were 16,612 earthquakes recorded, last year there were 25,404. The most well known section of Biblical prophecy is the book of Revelation and its visions, seals, bowls, vials, and beasts. Had I surveyed the audience this morning for your opinion of prophecy, I am sure that many of these prophets and their writing would have been listed as familiar sources of prophecy. I am also pretty sure that one name that would have been left off of the list would have been that of Paul. Paul actually spoke often about the return of Christ in most of his letters. In this letter to Timothy he offers a list of things that will be prevalent before Christ returns, including such things as men being lovers of their selves, coveting, pride, blasphemy, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, traitors, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God, and men that have a form of godliness, and denying the power. However, the one that I believe that God would have us focus on is found at the opening of verse three, “without natural affection.” What does this statement mean? It is often defined as homosexuality, but to fully understand being “without natural affection” one must turn to other passages that describe “natural affection.” The Bible tells of many things that are to be the “natural” love of man. Let’s look at a few examples of why I feel that this one statement gives us a good indication of where we are on the prophetic clock.",neutral,nikbarbagallo@me.com,Sermons_labelling,1534341183000,84.985,http://www.sermoncentral.com/sermons/the-prophecy-of-paul-james-barrett-sermon-on-second-coming-56048.asp,,gay_para_1000_NOSODOM.csv,[]

What is ignorance, is it a state of intellegence or lack of intelectual knowledge? Lets look as we cover the state of false religions. The state of False Religions. False religions in America and in the world will try to enter into communion with christianity to form one world religion.Knowledge is strength. Here is a list of false religions 1.Bahai 2.Buddhism 3.Hinduism 4.Jainism 5.Islam 6.Shinto 7.Taoism 8.Atheism 9. Zoroastrianism 10. Pluralism 11. Satanism And there are a few more isms in this world, too many to list. Christianity stands alone as the only true religion based on better promises, directly from God ,throu His Son Jesus.Its the only religion that assures the believer of life everlasting in the presents of the Allmighty God. Only the pure in heart shall see God. False religions have caused the christian numorious pains and afflicitions. Suciside bombers, rape, murder , abductions, putting fear into the everyday lives of Gods people. All in the name of religion. False religions have caused many their lives, dieing for a cause that in the end will be destroyed by Jesus Himself at Armogeddon. But in the while, we still suffer, but Peter tells us in, 1 Peter 2:19, For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. Who are the enemies of the Christian? There are three, Flesh, world and Satan. 1.Lets take the flesh first, at every oppertunity the flesh, when attacked, wants to fight back, to hurt those who have hurt it. To kill those who have tried to kill it. Lets take world events for example, when the moselms attack any christian institution the first thing the christians want to do is attack.But who do we attack, who is the guilty party? We dont know.But when we let the flesh take charge, missles, scream throu the night and flames flash up and innocient children are killed.The blood is flowing, and Satan is laughing, weve become as bad as the false religion that first set the attacks in motion.

cjkv0wtkbkhin0784esdom1ju,"Seeing beyond ourselves, our own passions and desires, means the development of a right conscience, one that conforms to the Truth: “the more right conscience holds sway, the more persons and groups turn aside from blind choice and strive to be guided by the objective norms of morality. Conscience frequently errs from invincible ignorance without losing its dignity. The same cannot be said for a man who cares but little for truth and goodness, or for a conscience which by degrees grows practically sightless as a result of habitual sin.” (Art 16) Telling ourselves or others that a sinful habit is OK is not compassionate. It is unjust to do so. A few years ago an auxiliary bishop up north found out his brother had left his wife and children and adopted a homosexual lifestyle. So he started preaching that perverse conduct is permissible. Very recently a prominent politician found out his son practiced homosexual conduct, and he switched his position on so-called homosexual marriage. The Truth tells us that morality is not relative, or determined by the behavior of your relatives. It tells us that certain actions are harmful to everyone–the persons involved, their families, and society as a whole. It is not an act of health to enslave yourself to your unjust passions. The Council Fathers said it well: “Only in freedom can man direct himself toward goodness. Our contemporaries make much of this freedom and pursue it eagerly; and rightly to be sure. Often however they foster it perversely as a license for doing whatever pleases them, even if it is evil. For its part, authentic freedom is an exceptional sign of the divine image within man. For God has willed that man remain ""under the control of his own decisions,"" so that he can seek his Creator spontaneously, and come freely to utter and blissful perfection through loyalty to Him. Hence man's dignity demands that he act according to a knowing and free choice that is personally motivated and prompted from within, not under blind internal impulse nor by mere external pressure.” (Art 17) Liberty is not the freedom to do whatever I feel like doing. It is the ability to avoid evil, and to do what is authentically good.",negative,nikbarbagallo@me.com,Sermons_labelling,1534330747000,45.562,http://www.sermoncentral.com/sermons/they-know-not-what-they-do-w-pat-cunningham-sermon-on-sin-bondage-to-174408.asp,,gay_para_1000_NOSODOM.csv,[]

cjkuxtatenchi07042wekk3pv,It is a scary time for Christians. You probably have seen the news where ‘gays’ (another nicer word for homosexuals) are going into Churches and disrupting services. Some will get in your face and scream at you. But if you demonstrate against them or their life style you will be called a ‘homophobe” or a hate monger or something that implies that good is evil – and evil is good. Let’s be clear. God calls homosexually evil and those practicing it will not go to heaven. A repentant homosexual who turns from his sin and to God has his sin blotted out. He is as pure as the new driven snow. But the one who loves his pleasure more than God will not inherit the kingdom of God. If we neglect to share that – it would be like watching someone take poison and not warn them.

It seems to matter not that the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel have different descriptions of the “sin of Sodom” and none of them refer to what we now call “sodomy.” Indeed, as the story goes in Genesis nineteen, the “sin” refers to public, non-consensual gang rape of two men by “all the townsmen of Sodom, both young and old- all the people to the last man Genesis 19 Sodom and Gomorrah Destroyed 1 The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city.

Maybe they were getting even with him for offering them as rape victims? The point is that we can hardly use the details of this whole bizarre tale to explain exactly what sin caused the destruction of either Sodom or Gomorrah.

I went to the Church’s website and there is a lot of hatred on the sight. Understand, I think homosexual activity as well as any type of pre-marital sex is a sin, but I also think that hatred is an even greater sin because it blocks our ability to minister love to those caught up in sin. We can hate the sin without hating the person. The words that this individual speaks on behalf of Christ are questionable at best. While I understand his desire to take a stand against sin, I do not think Jesus approves of his tactics. Jesus allowed people the opportunity to repent and He never immediately condemned anyone. Jesus would never be caught picketing a fallen soldier’s funeral saying that their death was justified because of the sin in America, especially the sin of homosexuality. Remember the story of the woman caught in adultery? When they brought her to Jesus they were ready to stone her. Remember what Jesus said to the crowd? When they quoted the Law of Moses about the woman being put to death, they pressed Jesus about His opinion in hope of trapping Him. Jesus began to write on the ground and finally He said these words: ""He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.""

Although He could have rightly condemned her, He chose not to in order to save her. Imagine her commitment to Jesus after He saved her life. How we approach individuals makes all of the difference as to whether or not they find Jesus within us. Please understand that I am not saying we should have an acceptance attitude for sin, but what I am saying is that in our desire to help the one caught in sin, we cannot shut the door to them receiving from us because they see condemnation within our eyes.

Say it with me. “The flesh counts for NOTHING.” What else did Jesus say? “No one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him.” Again - notice the word NO ONE. There is no ACCEPTING this message. It’s impossible to accept. The only way you can believe is if the FATHER enables you! This means there is no “free will” for people to make the choice to come to Jesus. Why? Because Jesus doesn’t fit in your brain - which is a part of your sinful flesh. Yet you see many people trying to “explain” Christianity yet today. These are the people who use reason to say, “God doesn’t really hate sin or sinners. We’re not really THAT sinful.” They reason, “God doesn’t really demand perfection, just try your best.” These are the theologians who explain, “hell isn’t really an eternal lake of fire. Hell is experienced on earth in the sense that people live without knowing God’s love.” These are the “defenders of God” who say, “Paul was just a homophobe and a bigot. He didn’t really mean that women should be silent in the church. Homosexuality isn’t really that bad. Sex outside of marriage is just a natural expression of love. Paul was just misled by his religious training and his society - which made him bring in his chauvenist and puritan views.” Another approach to today’s religion is to REMOVE the offensiveness of Christianity - to say that as long as you try to live a good life you’ll get in heaven - whether you believe in Jesus or not.

Our President and our Secretary of State claim the two terms—""freedom of worship"" and ""freedom of religion""—are interchangeable. But that’s nonsense. As Nina Shea at Freedom House told Christianity Today, mere freedom of worship ""excludes the right to raise your children in your faith...the right to...elect your religious leaders, to carry out charitable activities, to evangelize, [and] to have religious education or seminary training."" Even the Chinese allow freedom of worship. But if a Chinese pastor speaks out on political or cultural issues, prison, or worse, awaits him.

We see it in the use of antidiscrimination statutes to force religious institutions, businesses, and service providers of various sorts to comply with activities they judge to be deeply immoral or go out of business. After the judicial imposition of “same-sex marriage” in Massachusetts, for example, Catholic Charities chose with great reluctance to end its century-long work of helping to place orphaned children in good homes rather than comply with a legal mandate that it place children in same-sex households in violation of Catholic moral teaching. In New Jersey, after the establishment of a quasi-marital “civil unions” scheme, a Methodist institution was stripped of its tax exempt status when it declined, as a matter of religious conscience, to permit a facility it owned and operated to be used for ceremonies blessing homosexual unions. In Canada and some European nations, Christian clergy have been prosecuted for preaching Biblical norms against the practice of homosexuality.

What lies have you confronted this week on the tube? Do you firmly confess Him openly? You can do this because He has perfected you freely with His sacrifice. Become who you are—a witness—I will make you fishers of men, you shall be my witnesses.

(I find it funny that this argument is used to weasel out of the moral ideas of the Bible; many of those who make this case continue to argue for causes such as abortion and gay marriage. It seems a pretty far stretch from ""Was the Earth REALLY created by a Supreme Being?"" to abortion.

He does this because he knows what potential work can be done through ministry and wants to put a stop to it. It’s just the devil trying to build a case when people are jealous of you because God is putting and placing and replacing and moving. He wants them to pass judgment on you by trying to keep you from working when the Lord has given you the talent to work. He is trying to get them to pass a judgment of your not being worthy for what God has anointed you to do. He tells the jury that you used to be a crack head. He tells the jury you used to be a whoremonger. He tells the jury that you were once a homosexual. He tells the jury that you used to be a fighter. He tells the jury you used to be an alcoholic, a weed head, and a mean-spirited person. He tells them that you once were a murderer, a thief, and a liar. He tells them to forget the fact that the very life you used to live is not much different from the one they once lived. He tells them that there is no possible way that you could have been delivered. He tells them that they have a right to pass judgment on you. He tries tears you down with the judgment of the spiritual jury because he knows that if he can get judgment passed on you by the spiritual jury, he can weaken your effect in God’s ministry. He wants to stifle your work in kingdom building and edification of the body of Christ. He tries to tell the jury that when you lift your hands in praise, you’re faking it, or when you speak in tongues that it’s just vain babbling for you to get attention. He tries to get the jury to pass a judgment that you should not be allowed to preach because you’re not saying what they want to hear. He tries to get judgment passed that says you can’t preach if you’re a woman. He wants the jury to pass judgment to not let you work in the church.
